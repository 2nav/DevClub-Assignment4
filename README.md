## Task 1: Moodle+

You must have used moodle in your first semester, and observed it required you to solve a simple math question as a CAPTCHA.

Now, build a chrome extension which will solve this question automatically!

## Task 2: Wordle+

The current implementation of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is based completely on the front-end javascript code, so it is possible to find the answer by looking at the main javascript file of that page. Try doing this yourself!

This is not a secure way, so we are going to make a simple API, where the user can only make requests to our server with the guess, and the server returns the feedback response. This way, the user will not be able to directly hack the secret answer out of the program
